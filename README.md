# Powah Autocrafting using ComputerCraft Turtles

This is a [ComputerCraft](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked) program that automates the tedious crafting with the energizing orb from the [Powah mod](https://github.com/owmii/Powah). It was designed on Minecraft Version 1.16 running CC-Tweaked 1.95.2. The milage may vary on other versions.

### It currently supports 5 recipes
- Energized Steel from Iron and Gold Ingots
- Blazing Crystals from Blaze Rods
- Niotic Crystals from Diamonds
- Spirited Crystals from Emeralds
- Nitro Crystals from a Nether Star, two blocks of Redstone and one Blazing Crystal Block

### Running it on a turtle
- Place a turtle facing the energizing orb and give it a label
- Place a comparator onto the energizing orb and feed the redstone signal into the back of the turtle
- Run `pastebin get 34ZE8aNa startup` to download the program
- Reboot the turtle by holding `CTRL+R`

### Building the turtle program yourself
You can combine all the required source files by running `make turtle`
